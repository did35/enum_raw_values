        case tennessee = "Technicaly classified as bourbon. Producers are required by state law to produce their whiskeys in Tennessee."
        case rye = "Made in America, it follows the distilling process of bourbon. It tends to have a spicier flavor than sweeter."
        case blended = "It's a mixture of different types of whiskey, as well as colorings, flavors and even as other grains. They are ideal for cocktails."
        case singleMalt = "Single malt whisky needs to be made from one batch of scotch at a single distillery. It must be aged for three years in oak before being bottled."
